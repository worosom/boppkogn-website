She has been an avid vinyl collector for an eternity and got into djing 25 years ago. That Fucking Sara is a passionate Hip Hop lover with huge respect for the culture as a whole. Sara plays everything related to the history of rap music starting from way before the first rap tracks were recorded up to current variations of the genre - disco, electro, booty/miamibass, grime - you name it.She putted up her first event in her own apartment (!) which turned out to be such a successful party that she wasn’t able to live in that for two weeks after. Since that experience she decided to party anywhere else, which took her to a lot of different venues from an afterparty for Erasure to an art opening for Obey.During the last two decades That Fucking Sara has been playing festivals and clubs all over Europe and further abroad.Technically skilled as she is, she has been a tour- and stage-dj for Devin The Dude, Rah Digga, Guilty Simpson, Phat Kat, Yarah Bravo and many more and is currently tour dj for Älice

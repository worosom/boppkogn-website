  DJ Primark, a.k.a. Jeremy-William Hermes, a.k.a “the music nerd” comes from a small town on the countryside and moved to Berlin several years ago with all intentions to make it as a DJ (LOL just kidding). Jeremy started out as a Techno DJ, however he lost interest in that very quickly, so he decided to bring something new to the table and not take himself so seriously.

  While there is a preference for Grime and bass heavy belters, as the audience you can never know what to expect from his sets, because of his "No-Genre-Borders”-Policy. Be prepared for surprises!

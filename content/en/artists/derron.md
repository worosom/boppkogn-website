_DERRON_ started his musical career at the beginning of the millennium.   
  
 Taking his first steps he accompanies rappers like _Fabster_, _Hecklar&Coch_, as well as the _EastSide Famlee_ as a support act.   
  
 In 2003 he was drawn from his home town Halle to the capital. In Berlin, hidden in the Universal studios, DERRON produced the album _"Ihr kennt uns nicht!"_ (-'you don't know us'-) of the group _Phonetik_ with well-known Berlin artists like _Sookee_ and _DJ Mesia_.   
  
 During this time he also met Nonpareil producer Dennis Kuhn. Together they took the stage from 2008 on in order to heat up a rap-enthusiastic audience featuring artists like _VisaVie_, _Noize & Nandez_ and _Hammer & Zirkel_.   
  
 Said project includes collaborations with many international musicians, such as the End of the Weak's co-founder _Webbafied_, the Algerian pop singer _Zela_ or with _Daveman_, the front man of the African duo _Foulaa System_. With the release of his first debut solo album _"Rap Is Liebe"_ DERRON returns to his roots.

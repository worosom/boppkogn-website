Various contests, tours throughout club landscape and a runner-up title at the ,Red Bull Threestyle finals Germany' speak for themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
As a tour DJ for Trettmann, she recently played in renowned halls and on festival stages.
  <br>
  <br>
Currently she is on the road again through Germany, Austria and Switzerland. This time solo! She focuses on sets that cross genre boundaries, whose course can hardly be pigeonholed by the fusion of rap, Soundcloud-edits and electronic bass music. In addition to playing clubs and festival shows every week, she regularly hosts hand-picked guests from different areas of the local hip-hop landscape on her podcast \"Deine Homegirls\" with journalist Helen Fares. She also just appeared as a studio DJ on the German remake of \"YO! MTV Raps\". Currently she produces warm lofi beats and is part of the producing duo \"Import Export\"."

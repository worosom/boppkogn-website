 His roots as DJs range back to the late 90s, where he started DJing and felt in love with Trip Hop, Soul, Jazz as well as Electronic Dance Music. He got inspired by Hip Hop DJs as well as the good House and Techno greats. This background roots are enough to combine various genre influences and let it flow into his DJ sets today. His DJ sets do impress with fine DJ craftsmanship and are able to blend smoothly through different styles, like Soul, Jazz, Disco, House. The mission is a well selected, varied and genre-spanning selection,which is for both, bars and clubs outstanding.

He has co-organized events with Sonar Kollektiv and Best Works (Too Many Treats), XJAZZ (Raw Tapes Special), JAW Family, Gretchen (Max Greaf Band record release) and collaborated with the Southern Soul Festival in Berlin. Currently he is organizing Jazzanova’s monthly club event KALEIDOSKOP.

 Under the motto "soulful music we like" he started the event series WEDDING SOUL (based in Berlin’s district Wedding) in 2012, with the aim of enriching Berlin’s music and club landscape with more soul and a wider range of soulful music offside the mainstream.

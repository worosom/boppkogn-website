Berlin based Wanja of I still love H.E.R. aka Wan.illa NICE has been involved in the Hip Hop industry since 2002. Early on, she covered everything from interviewing artists, podcasts, international mixtapes, artist management, tour booking and road management in the US as well as in Europe. 

In 2004 she established the blog [www.IstillLoveHER.de](www.IstillLoveHER.de) and her PR / Promotion agency under the same name, which became her full time job. Wanja spent the following years building the brand, reputation and knowledge which has made her a household name in Hip Hop. She now runs a popular Instagram page and continues helping artists to success through PR, promotion and social media marketing. Most importantly, Wanja has remained a true fan and supporter of the art which in 2018 led her to DJing, to do what she loves most: sharing music with the people. As a DJ, her aim is to showcase all eras of Hip Hop and prove that they can beautifully coexist. 

Having played gigs in Berlin's most beloved Hip Hop venues (Yaam, Festsaal Kreuzberg, Klunkerkranich, Badehaus and more), at one of Europe's biggest festivals Hip Hop Kemp, opening up for artists such as Wu-Tang's GZA and Rah Digga, and holding a monthly residency at Berlin's Swag Jam; Wan.illa NICE has made her mark and is ready to take over the rest of the world. Now staying in South Africa again for an extended period, she has played in venues all over Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban (Great Dane, Kitcheners, Romeo's, Saint, The Charlatan, Yours Truly, Smoking Kills, The Living Room, Throwback Chillout, The Waiting Room and more) and was a repeat guest DJ on the legendary Ready D show on Good Hope FM. She currently hosts her own weekly event "NICE nights" at Lonely Hearts Club in Johannesburg.

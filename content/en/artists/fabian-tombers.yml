bio: >-
  Fabian Tombers is a communication designer, researcher and activist who focuses on design as an agent for change.
  <br><br>
  Design is a tool for the hegemony to keep the power structures in place. To disrupt this we need to venture into the unknown. Question our habits, speculate on our futures and develop new ways of knowing.
  <br><br>
  Interested in the way educational institutions foster environments that create intersections between learning, teaching, research and practices, he explores what a design practice of resistance may look like.

bio: >-
  <em>DERRON</em> started his musical career at the beginning of the millennium.
  <br>
  Taking his first steps he accompanies rappers like <em>Fabster</em>, <em>Hecklar&Coch</em>, as well as the <em>EastSide Famlee</em> as a support act.
  <br>
  In 2003 he was drawn from his home town Halle to the capital. In Berlin, hidden in the Universal studios, DERRON produced the album <em>"Ihr kennt uns nicht!"</em> (-'you don't know us'-) of the group <em>Phonetik</em> with well-known Berlin artists like <em>Sookee</em> and <em>DJ Mesia</em>.
  <br>
  During this time he also met Nonpareil producer Dennis Kuhn. Together they took the stage from 2008 on in order to heat up a rap-enthusiastic audience featuring artists like <em>VisaVie</em>, <em>Noize & Nandez</em> and <em>Hammer & Zirkel</em>.
  <br>
  Said project includes collaborations with many international musicians, such as the End of the Weak's co-founder <em>Webbafied</em>, the Algerian pop singer <em>Zela</em> or with <em>Daveman</em>, the front man of the African duo <em>Foulaa System</em>. With the release of his first debut solo album <em>"Rap Is Liebe"</em> DERRON returns to his roots.

Fabian Tombers is an artist and Designer, rethinking our relationship with production and being, through improvised performances with sound and special installations. The pandemic fired all of us to reimagine what everyday life could be. Fabians work proposes that escaping the technocratic dictatorship of time might help us to find a place for radical imagination somewhere behind the curtains. With sonic interventions, Tombers builds spaces and situations in euch reality can be torn to pieces, revealing the timeless and the communal. By doing so, he shows the potential to change the space we inhabit and the way we treat each other.

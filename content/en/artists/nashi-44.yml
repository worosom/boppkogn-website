bio: >-
  Nashi is the self-proclaimed <em>FIERCE VIET GERMAN RAPPER</em>, whose clever and timely lyrics pull from personal experiences: encounters with microaggressions and everyday racism, the exoticization of Asian women, and more. Nashi has been particularly active this year with releasing rap videos on Instagram (2021 is Nashi's year, I'm telling you ). She even performed live at the Berlin demonstration for the victims of Atlanta.â€œ Asiangermanupdates, 2021

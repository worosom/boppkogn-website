With a career spanning almost 30 years, there’s no doubt Marc Hype is a sure shot party rocker who
represents a more eclectic view on Hip Hop & Funk from the very beginning.
He started his DJ career, inspired by the late great Jam Master Jay, around 1988 and went through the

During this time he collaborated and recorded with artists like the Juice Crew legend Masta Ace, Souls Of
Mischief, Edo G., Zion I, Beat Junkies, DJ Z-Trip, Patrick Pulsinger, Killa Kela, Akrobatik & Mr. Lift o name a
few. His solo-debut album “1973 * Recon“ became “Album of the month“ in Europe’s biggest Hip Hop
Magazine JUICE in 2003.
In the year 2004 he met world class pianist Jim Dunloop in Berlin and quickly they began to collaborate on
shows and production. His proven skills on the decks combined with the undisputed talent of Dunloop's key

"Bombay Raw" & "Finale 74", which were very successful in the worldwide dj-circuit, followed by a cover
version of Babe Ruth's "The Mexican" in 2006, which was dubbed by UK's Jazzman Gerald as "the" version

In 2009 the album "Stamp out reality" was released on MPM Rec. which featured artists like the legendary

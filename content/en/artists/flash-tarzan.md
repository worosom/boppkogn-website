Flash Tarzan puts strong moods and images to beats, not without a touch of wordplay and self-irony. Sometimes a bit bulky, the music always leaves enough room for the listener’s imagination and offers diversified starting-points. With a present voice and stage presence the Berlin based rapper shows pleasure in performing live. Last year the Luxbau-Kombinat-member dropped his EP “Plenum im Streichelcafé”.

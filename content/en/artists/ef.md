E.F started his music career in 1999. Inspired by the great classics of the 70’s & 80's, and the 90's rise of the Hip Hop culture, he began buying records and spinning at students parties. His records collection was constantly growing and he kept on improving his technical skills which respectfully earned him his first live performance as a guest DJ at Berlin's Am To Pm in 2000, and as a result his first residency. In appreciation of his work, early fans liked to nickname him DJ Biggie. Mixing astounding sets, he strongly marked his freestyle fingerprints on the Berlin nightlife scene where he established numerous connections with world class DJs and producers. 

From Underground and Old school Hip Hop and Rn'B, to Funk, Soul, and Reggae, always playing and scratching on the good old solid turntables while also staying up to date with the latest technologies in addition to mastering the art of live video turntablism.
